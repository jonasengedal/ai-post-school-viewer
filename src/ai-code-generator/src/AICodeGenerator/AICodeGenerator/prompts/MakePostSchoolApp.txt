Make me a Vue application that can list all the "efterskoler" in a table and show them on a Leaflet map.  
The following "efterskole" properties must be supported: Navn, KortBeskrivelse, LangBeskrivelse, GpsKoordinater, Adresse, Linjefag, Valgfag, ObligatoriskeFag, Type.
The list and map must be visible at the same time.
The list must show the properties Navn, By, KortBeskrivelse, Type.
Zooming in the map will filter the list to only show the "efterskoler" that are visible in the map.
Hovering an "efterskole" in the list will highlight the "efterskole" in the map and vice versa.
The map must support toggle fullscreen on/off.
The list must for each "efterskole" have a button called "Sammenlign".
When clicking the button called "Sammenlign" the "efterskole" will be added to a list of "efterskoler" to compare. The list must be stored in local storage.
A button "Vis sammenligning" must open a new page with a comparison table of the "efterskoler" in the list for comparison.
The comparison table must have the "efterskole" properties as rows and each "efterskole" as columns.
It must be possible to edit the information of an "efterskole".
The "efterskoler" must be fetched from an .NET API which you must also provide me the code for.
Make the C# class for "efterskole".
Use Bootstrap as layout framework.
